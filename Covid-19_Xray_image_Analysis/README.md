# Covid-19 Xray Images Analysis and Prediction Project

This project includes 5 parts:

1. Dataset description and visualize datset 

2. Data prepoccessing

3. Build and fine-tune deep learning model(Resnet50/VGG16)

4. Evaluate trained deep learning model

5. Test model and prediction evaluation


## model:
* Resnet50
* VGG16
The Resnet50 model performs better than VGG16.


## datasetsï¼š
The dataset comes from kaggle data which includes 3 types of X-ray images covid-19,normal and viral pneumonia.
