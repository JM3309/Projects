# Seoul bike analysis project

In this analysis project, we focus on the bike sharing demand in Seoul, Korea and try to explore the relationship between hourly rented bikes demand and some influencing factors. 
We wish to build a Poisson regression model on all observed data and use Bayesian methods to find the posterior distribution of the coefficients. We will try to discover how differnt priors on \beta will affect the posterior distribution. We suggest three priors, a flat prior, a normal prior with Inverse-Gamma variance, and a normal prior with Half-Cauchy vairance. 

## Model
* Flat prior
* a normal prior with Inverse-Gamma variance
* a normal prior with Half-Cauchy vairance
